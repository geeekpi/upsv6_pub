# TFT Module Feature 
Even if the Raspberry Pi is powered off and the UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) is also shut down, UPSv6 will continue to execute PikaPython code that you have uploaded before unless the power is totally being cut off.
* This is one of the new features of UPSv6. 
* If you need to turn off the display, you can either set the screen to black or disconnect all power supplies before shutting down.
* TODO: software control backlight.
